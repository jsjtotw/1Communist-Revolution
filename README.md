# 1Communist-Revolution
After the collapse of the Dictatorship of Ms. Tan, 1C has erupted into civil war. After Vera unfairly asked 1C to pay $2.20 for the Geography Resource Booklet Part 3, Joshua Tan Shao Jie has become discontented. He has been secretly amassing weapons and allies to lauch a communist revolution against the class. The time seems right to revolt now, and it seems like nothing would stop him. Rheia formed a provisional government, uniting Most of the Class Comitee and the teachers of 1C. While the communists and provisional government are distracted with their petty squabble, the Kpop salvationists strike, forming a third force in the war.
